# Rainfall Data Visualization with Matplotlib

## This repo contains visualizations done over the rainfall data taken from [http://data.gov.in](https://data.gov.in/catalog/rainfall#) for the month on January 2022 across all states an their districts in India.

### Scatter Plot
The first plot is a scatter plot of daily avg. rainfal Uttarkashi district in Uttarakhand.
We see that there are a few dayas with decent rainfall but mostly its 0. 
This is quite representative of January weather in Uttarakhand where in we have occasional cold showers owing to its altitude and atmospheric conditions.

### Box Plot
The second plot is a box plot of daily avg. rainfall in Jaunary 2022 across all districts in Uttarakhand.
We can see that in most cases rainfall is around 0.
However a lot of outliers can be seen which gives a good visualization of how random the weather, especially showers in Uttarakhand can be.
Dehradun seems to have higher probability of these ocassional showers.

### Bar plot
The third plot is a bar plot of the total of daily avg. rainfall for the month of January 2022 across all districts of Uttarakhand.
As seen in previous plot, Dehradun has the highest amount of rainfall recieved owing to its more erratica showers.
In general, we can see that Uttarakhand is not all dry during winters and has decent rainfall, as expected in hilly terrains.
